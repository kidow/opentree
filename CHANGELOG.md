# Changelog

All notable changes to this project should be recorded in this file.

The format is intentionally simple:

- Keep an `Unreleased` section at the top.
- Move entries into a versioned section when a release is cut.
- Prefer short user-facing bullets over implementation detail dumps.

### Desktop App (Tauri)

- Add Rust workspace and `opentree-core` crate — foundation for native binary
- Move Node.js CLI to `apps/legacy-cli` to make room for Rust core
